I was sent this as a coding exercise for a contract application.
I wasn't paid for this work, so I'm making the solution public, although I've rewritten the rubric
to avoid copyright issues.  The problem itself has no invention or algorithm or any value.

The "client" wishes to have a Live Order Board for buying and selling of silver bars.

Requirement 1: Add an order. This should have user id, quantity (grams), price per kg (Â£) and BUY/SELL
Requirement 2: Ability to remove an order after placement.
Requirement 3: Display current buy/sell orders
  * 3.1 - "buy" orders displayed in decreasing order of price
  * 3.2 - "sell" orders displayed in increasing order of price
  * 3.3 - orders of the same type, for the same price, are merged
