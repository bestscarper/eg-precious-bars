#### Silver Bars
I was sent this as a coding exercise for a contract application.

I wasn't paid for this work, so I'm making the solution public, although I've rewritten the rubric
to avoid copyright issues.

The "client" wishes to have a Live Order Board for buying and selling of silver bars.

Requirement 1: Add an order. This should have the following properties:
  * user id
  * quantity (grams)
  * price per kg (Â£)
  * BUY/SELL

Requirement 2: Ability to remove an order after placement.

Requirement 3: Display current buy/sell orders
  * 3.1 - "buy" orders displayed in decreasing order of price
  * 3.2 - "sell" orders displayed in increasing order of price
  * 3.3 - orders of the same type, for the same price, are merged

This was submitted for assessment in Sept 2015 - I never heard back about my
application.  It seems you are still fielding the same test in Sept 2018,
so I'll resubmit my solution,
at least in hope that you'll provide positive feedback about how it could
more accurately meet your standards.
